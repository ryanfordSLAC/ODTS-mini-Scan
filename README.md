# ODTS-mini-Scan
Created November, 2023

The purpose of the mini-Scan is to enable users of the personal dosimeter service to register dosimeter returns directly into ODTS and receive an email confirmation.  This transaction is intended to reduce or eliminate cases where the user states they've returned it, but the dosimetry group hasn't received it.  More importantly, the transaction supplies written proof of the return via email.
